Fran, but in python (for the dorks who can't program in cpp, aka, me)
Basically, I'm going to spend like 3 days agonizing over this and then give up. Probably. Feel free to help.

For the bot to run continuously, we need it to be implemented on the server, not my shoddy old Mac. So until we have the server issues fixed, this babe is going to be a part-time worker.
Also, if we want AI implementation (basically, the bot can answer FAQs and interact moderately with server members if triggered):
- install neuralintents
- from corpora (an nltk thing) install omw-1.4
